      "text": "Photosynthesis is a two-stage process occurring in the chloroplasts of plant cells. In the light-dependent reactions, chlorophyll absorbs sunlight and uses it to split water molecules, releasing oxygen and generating ATP and NADPH. In the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle), these energy carriers are used to convert carbon dioxide into glucose. The overall equation is: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂. This process is fundamental to life on Earth, as it produces oxygen and forms the base of most food chains.",
