Let's not forget who Musk's biggest fans were before gears finally started turning in people's heads and they realized that popular science lovers might just also be capable of being horrible people. \n\nI have been around these people for most of my life at this point. You can argue that their clueless nature flies in the face of what the scientific method is. But the majority of STEM is defined by this kind of psychopathy and the delusion that science is purely objective. \n\nI met someone who worked on cybernetics and AI back in the mid 2000s. They told me their dream was to create a form of self-consciousness. I asked them a basic question about the ethics of that. You know, the thing that scifi has driven into the ground over and over again. He looked at me blankly and said he'd \"never thought about that before.\" \n\nI was at a party and a graduate student there was specializing in ordnance testing. He gleefully told us all about how he drops bombs on live pigs all day. He didn't understand how it was off-putting. \n\nOne of my classmates was writing a dissertation on vivisection and designing glass portals to allow vivisectors to look into rats while doing tests on them. I talked to them about the history of vivisection and when it is and isn't allowed. They didn't care. They just wanted to make windows in flesh. \n\nWe as students always had to attend multidisciplinary research seminars on how to conduct research. They were mostly catered towards STEM, including a session on the ethics of testing. Not a single STEM in that session gave a shit what was going on. They all considered ethics a waste of time. \n\nThe mad scientist trope exists for a reason. These people are in an environment that nurtures psychopathy. And it has only gotten worse as STEM has dropped philosophy and other humanities requirements from its programs. They literally do not know where their fields come from, how they evolved alongside deep questions about the cosmos, and how inquiry rather than blind experimentation starts lasting conversations. Throw in some neurodivergence and capitalism and we are all well and truly fucked.",
